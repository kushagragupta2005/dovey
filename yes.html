    <h1>My Love, My Tisha ❤️</h1>
    <p>
        Never ever had I thought I would have someone to love me for who I am.<br>
        Never ever had I thought I would have someone to understand me for who I am.<br><br>

        The past year was the best year I had just because of you.<br>
        The brightest star or even the moon itself can't compare if it's you.<br><br>

        People say it's God who sees you and believes in you,<br>
        But all I know is that my God herself is in you.<br><br>

        It wouldn't be right to just praise you all the way and not mention any of your mistakes.<br>
        I really would have done so if I had found any, but I only saw your beautiful face,<br>
        That prettiest smile, those enchanting eyes—oh no, I couldn't escape.<br><br>

        Never ever had I thought I would love someone this much for who I am.<br>
        Never ever had I thought I would be in total sync with someone for who I am.<br><br>

        Well, it's not about who you were or who you will be in the future now.<br>
        All that matters is what you have become, with the person alongside, by your side, to the person you vowed.<br><br>

        That person is you, my Tisha. That someone is none other than my one and only Tisha.<br><br>

        Happy Valentine's Day to my love, my dovey, my jaanu, my everything—for being not just a part of my life, but my whole life.
